The Scheme portfolio would acquire; inter alia; small and medium size businesses with good long term potential; which are available at cheap valuations. Such securities would be identified through disciplined fundamental research keeping in view medium to longterm trends in the business environment. The Scheme shall endeavor to accumulate long-term investor wealth by opening subscriptions to units during periods when stocks are available at reasonable valuations. By doing so; the Fund managers would endeavor to prevent shortterm money from flowing into the fund which can prove detrimental to the interests of long-term investors. As the scheme would be sold to investors with a long-term investment horizon; it is also expected that the portfolio would remain relatively more insulated to day to day redemption pressures. The fund will close subscription; once it has collected a predetermined “manageable” corpus (approximate amount); which will be decided by the fund manager of the scheme depending on the available investment opportunities in the stock market / if the fund manager is of the opinion that investment opportunities have diminished. Thus the fund manager will endeavour to ensure that there are sufficient assets available to meet the long-term objectives of the fund.","portfolio_turnover":"0.58","maturity_type":"Open
